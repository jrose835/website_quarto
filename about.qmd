## More About Me

I'm a self-taught coder who works primarily in R on a daily basis, but I've also branched out to a few other languages and tools. I've got a particular interest in applying a deeper understanding of statistics to laboratory experiments, understanding how epigenetics regulates gene expression, and using data visualization techniques for genomic data.


### My focus areas include:

-   Next generation sequencing data analysis

    -   RNAseq, ATACseq, single-cell sequencing, whole-genome sequencing

-   Data Visualization

    -   All things ggplot...trying my hand at a little Javascript/Observable/D3 recently

-   Applying biological know-how to design good questions for large complex data analysis

-   Gene regulatory network analysis

-   Epigenetics

-   Autoimmune disease and B cell tolerance mechanisms
