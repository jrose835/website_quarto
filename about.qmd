## More About Me

I'm a computational biologist and a self-taught coder who works primarily in R on a daily basis (but also python when needed). 

I've got a particular interest in applying statistics, network analysis, and AI/ML natural language processing tools to large sequencing data sets & laboratory experiments.

### My focus areas include:

-   Next generation sequencing data analysis

    -   RNAseq, ATACseq, single-cell sequencing, whole-genome sequencing

-   Designing or maintaining bioinformatic pipelines

-   Data Visualization

    -   All things ggplot...trying my hand at a little Javascript/Observable/D3 recently

-   Applying biological know-how to design good questions for large complex data analysis

-   Gene regulatory network analysis

-   Epigenetics

-   Autoimmune disease and B cell tolerance mechanisms
