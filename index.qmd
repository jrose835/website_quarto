Hello! This is where I'm building my personal website using Quarto.

## About Me

I'm a PhD candidate at Emory University studying Genetics & Molecular biology. I work on autoimmunity and gene regulation of the immune system using the tools of computational biology.

I'm a self-taught coder who works primarily in R on a daily basis, but I've also branched out to a few other languages and tools. I've got a particular interest in applying a deeper understanding of statistics to laboratory experiments as well as data visualization.

## My focus areas include:

-   Next generation sequencing data analysis

    -   RNAseq, ATACseq, single-cell sequencing, whole-genome sequencing

-   Data Visualization

    -   All things ggplot..trying my hand at a little Javascript/Observable/D3 recently

-   Applying biological know-how to design good questions for large complex data analysis

-   Gene regulatory network analysis

-   Epigenetics
