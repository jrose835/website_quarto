Hello! This is where I'm building my personal website using Quarto.

## About Me

I'm a PhD candidate at Emory University studying Genetics & Molecular biology. I work on autoimmunity and gene regulation of the immune system using the tools of computational biology.

## This Site

I plan to use this site to host my contact/CV information as well as a place to highlight side projects I am working on.
